# Battleship Game (Battaglia Navale)

This is an old university project developed during my Bachelor's degree, implemented in Java 1.8 using the Eclipse IDE. It is a complete version of the classic **Battleship** game, featuring a graphical interface, customizable gameplay and multiple game modes including matches against CPU.

## Features

- Full implementation of the classic Battleship game
- Single-player mode against CPU
- Multiple CPU strategies and difficulty levels
- Customizable match settings (grid size, ship types and count, etc.)
- Save and load functionality: matches can be paused and resumed
- Multi-window graphical interface using standard Java libraries (Swing/AWT)

## How to Run

**Requirements:**
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE

**Execution:**

No installation required. To run the game:

1. Open Eclipse
2. Import the project into your workspace (`File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`)
3. Launch the main class using the green *Run* button

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into packages:

- `gui`: user interface and window management
- `game`: game logic and rule enforcement
- `ai`: artificial intelligence strategies
- `persistence`: save/load game state


## Notes

- This project was developed for educational purposes.
- Despite being slightly outdated, it showcases a clean object-oriented design and a complete GUI-based game built from scratch in Java.
